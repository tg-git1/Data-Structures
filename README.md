# Data Structures Learning Tool

This micro-learning web application is designed to teach data structures like stack and queue through everyday analogies and interactive inputs. Real-life examples make understanding concepts easier and more engaging.
For instance, a programming stack resembles a stack of books or plates, while a programming queue can be compared to a queue of people at a counter or in a line. 

## Backend
Flask (Python)
* Serves the webpage (index.html)
* Stores and processes the stack and queue operations
* Provides push, pop, enqueue and dequeue

## Frontend
HTML
* Analogy and definiton fields
* Buttons for type of data structure and operation
* Input field to enter the element

## Frontend Logic
Javascript
* Collects the inputs given by the user
* Sends requests to Flask
* Updates the webpage

## Page Styling
CSS
